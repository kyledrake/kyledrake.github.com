                  Economist and former prisoner of war R. A. Radford describes an economic system that arised while interned in a Prisoner of War camp, where cigarettes
                  became a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_money">commodity money</a> and were used to facilitate exchange. Cigarettes would enter the economy 
                  in varying levels of supply, causing effects in their small-scale macroeconomy that compare to its large scale counterparts,
                  including price shocks, inflation and deflation, price fixing, agreements, and hoarding. This article adds strong credit to the theory that the first currencies, like
                  Bitcoin, were not regulated by a central authority. They were distributed, and built spontaneously by unrelated individuals looking to improve their standard of material comfort.
